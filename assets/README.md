# Mini-quiz
Create a mini-quiz that tests javascript knwoledge

## Introduction and Objective
This project aims to provide an avenue to implement our understanding of logical arguments, 
how to navigate the DOM elements and finally how to add values into a local storage 
as well as retrieve values from local storage.

## challenges
This project is arguably the most challenging one so far. I encountered problems every step of the way, from creating DOM elemets to creating timer, to logical arguments looping, to creating a local storage, and acessing the local storage. But with help from tutors and other sources i managed to overcome most of them.
